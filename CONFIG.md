# Config

Adding a new app is as easy as this:
```toml
[Some-App]
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/inc/app"
```

or:
```toml
[Some-App]
uptodown-dlurl = "https://app.en.uptodown.com/android"
```

## If you'd like to get to know more about other options:

There exists an example below with all defaults shown and all the keys explicitly set.  
**All keys are optional** (except download urls) and are assigned to their default values if not set explicitly.  

```toml
patches-source = "revanced/revanced-patches" # where to fetch patches bundle from. default: "revanced/revanced-patches"
integrations-source = "revanced/revanced-integrations" # where to fetch integrations from. default: "revanced/revanced-integrations"
rv-brand = "ReVanced Extended" # rebrand from 'ReVanced' to something different. default: "ReVanced"

patches-version = "v2.160.0" # locks the patches version. default: latest available
integrations-version = "v0.95.0" # locks the integrations version. default: latest available

[Some-App]
app-name = "SomeApp" # if set, app name becomes SomeApp instead of Some-App. default is same as table name, which is 'Some-App' here.
# this affects the release name and stuff like that
enabled = true # whether to build the app. default: true
build-mode = "both" # 'both', 'apk' or 'module'. default: apk
allow-alpha-version = false # allow downloading alpha versions from apkmirror. default: false
excluded-patches = "some-patch" # whitespace seperated list of patches to exclude. default: "" (empty)
included-patches = "patch-name" # whitespace seperated list of patches to include, all default patches are included by default. default: "" (empty)
version = "auto" # 'auto', 'latest' or a custom one e.g. '17.40.41'. 'auto' option gets the latest version that is supported by the patches. default: auto
exclusive-patches = false # exclude all patches by default. default: false
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/inc/app" # download url. if not set, uptodown dl url is used.
uptodown-dlurl = "https://spotify.en.uptodown.com/android" # uptodown url. if not set, apkmirror dl url is used. apkmirror is prioritized
module-prop-name = "ytrv-magisk" # magisk module prop name. not required.
arch = "arm64-v8a" # 'arm64-v8a', 'arm-v7a' or 'all'. default: all
# arch option is sometimes needed to be able to download the apks from apkmirror.
# and does not affect anything else
```

# Building ReVanced Extended
Use [`config-rv-ex.toml`](./config-rv-ex.toml) as the config by replacing config.toml with it
